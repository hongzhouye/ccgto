Auxiliary basis sets are optimized by minimizing the atomic HF energies/JK
matrices as well as the MP2 correlation energy. The following cost function
integrates all of the targets above:

	Cost = fac * (vj_err + vk_err) + ej_err + ek_err + ecorr_mp2_err

where
- vj_err and vk_err are the maximum absolute error of the HF J and K matrices
- ej_err and ek_err are the absolute error of the Coulomb and exchange
energies
- ecorr_mp2_err is the absolute error of the MP2 correlation energy
- fac is a tunable parameter accounting for the fact that J/K matrices can
tolerate larger errors than energies.

Three tiers are defined:
- Normal:    Cost < 1e-5, fac = 5
- Tight:     Cost < 1e-5, fac = 3
- VeryTight: Cost < 5e-6, fac = 3

The optimization proceeds by trimming the AutoAux fitting basis (which is
often much more accurate than the ETB) until the desired cost threshold
is reached.

"Normal" should be sufficient in most calculations.

Note: limited support for small-core basis sets at this point, which will be
fixed soon.
